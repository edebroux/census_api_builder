    "First, the base URL for any dataset is always `https://api.census.gov/data`. If you want data for a specific year, such as 2019, add that to the year argument. Finally, if you want CBP data for any year from 1986 to 2019, specify the `cbp` in the program name argument. For ZBP, specify `cbp` in the program name for any data from 2017 onwards and specify `zbp` for any data from 1994 to 2018 (yes, there is some overlap in years, 2017 & 2018, between the sources). \n",
