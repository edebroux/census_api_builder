# census_api_builder

The `census_api_builder` repository will be used to help Milwaukee-based data users build Census API requests for data related for Milwaukee. Currently, I am starting to help build API requests for two Census economic products using Jupyter Notebook:

* County Business Pattern (CBP)
* Nonemployer Statistics (NES)

In the future, I intend to create additional Jupyter Notebook notebooks to build API requests from different Census Programs, such as the American Community Survey, the Annual Business Survey, etc.
