    "```\n",

    "First, the base URL for any dataset is always `https://api.census.gov/data`. BDS data is considered a time series, so the year argument is a little different. Instead of specifying the year after `data/`, enter `timeseries`. If you want a specific year, you can specify a `&YEAR=YYYY` argument in the predicate.\n",
